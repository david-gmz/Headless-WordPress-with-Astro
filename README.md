# Headless WordPress with AstroJS 5 Test

First attempt at creating an AstroJS website with headless WordPress, which basically means using the WordPress database as content storage while AstroJS handles the frontend.

Plus, it's my first project with Astro, which seems surprisingly easy!

## TypeError: fetch failed
I face my first issue with https in local server with a crash in the app. I tried several solutions without success, so I keep the protocol in local as http only.
